# Mailchimp-Newsletter-App
This website allowed people to sign up for my newsletter when I was making healthy recreations of dessert foods last summer.
The newsletter lets them know when the business is running and what products are available.
Everytime a user submits the form with their first name, last name, and email, a POST request is made to the Mailchimp API using the information.
If the request is successful, the user is then logged onto my list of users under the Mailchimp database.
Otherwise, it must mean a bad request has been made (i.e. user did not submit a valid email).
